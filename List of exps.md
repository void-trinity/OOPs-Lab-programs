#C++ lab manual
1. Matrix Inversion -take as input, a value n from the user. Create a 2D integer array A of size n
x n. Input the square matrix from the user. Compute the inverse of the matrix named as B.
Display the inverse and verify that AB = I (unit matrix of size n x n)
2. Longest common subsequence: Take as input two strings A and from the user (not necessarily
of equal size), find the length of longest common subsequence present in both of them and
display one such subsequence.
3. Create a class Complex, the object of which represents a complex number. The class has two
data members real and imaginary. Implement member functions to add, subtract, multiply and
divide two complex numbers.
